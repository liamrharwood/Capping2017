* I don't recall we discussed anything about showing your temples or preferred
places of worship. Instead, PSN is interested in connecting people of the same
religion regardless of in which temple they worhsip. So, the profile should
list they preferred religious community.

* It seems like there is no wireframe showing how can I comment on a prayer.

* It seems like there is no wireframe showing a user's reputation.

Please work harder on this project.
